This statement raises a variety of issues about duty, courage and politeness. On balance, I fundamentally agree that we should talk to the teacher or the  meeting leader after the class or meeting comparing with another means when it comes with this situation. In fact, we need to answer both of questions that if we should point out the fault of our teacher who have more knowledge and which ways we should choose to deal with this issue when we decide to correct this mistake, while we try to determine which is the best option among them.

The fist question has to do with duty and courage.

The second has to do with politeness.
