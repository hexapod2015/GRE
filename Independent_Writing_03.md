### Writing

Many people assert that we should more focus on the field we are major in by common sence. I, however, fundamentally agree that all university students ought to learn history courses no matter what their field of study is. It is reasonable that the universities design those curriculum of general education, such as history course, to help the students to enhance their comperhencsive capability. There are two mainly reasons to impose us on taking our time to learn history courses.



The first reason is that the university general education that history courses offer is requirable. A great many modern students are lack of general education. They spend lots of time in focusing on their major subject and ignore the importance of the general education courses like history. Because, in their opinion, these courses are useless and can not help them to obtain a good job or academic achievements. Yet, in fact, not only should a university design courses to teach the students knowledges, but offer some courses to help them get the answers of the a variety of  issues about aesthetics、arts and culture. That is the meaning of the history courses and the other general education courses.



The second reason is that the capability you obtain fron the history courses can assist you to study your major field. Through the history courses, what you learn is histotical experience. For example, when you want to do an advanced attempt in your major field, the historical experience will show you wether there are oppertunities for you to reach your aims. If someone have taken the similar expriments with your imagenation, you can avoid the failure and try another plans to reach the goal more quickly basing the others' experiences.



The implicit rational of disagreement of this statement is these historical courses take time of another more crucial major courses.
