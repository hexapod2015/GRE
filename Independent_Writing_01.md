### Outline

- agree

1. 现在，网络服务也是公共服务的一部分，所以应该免费提供。
2. 提供这个对于政府是有好处的，可以从中获利，类比修路。
3. 有额外成本，大型企业失去了赚钱的机会，但是对于政府而言收益大于成本。







Many people assert that we should pay for internet access by common sence. I believe, however, that gorvernments ought to provide the service without extra payment on the basis that social benifits will accrue when goverment plays an active role in providing internet access, an necessary public service.



One reason why I agree the statement is that this service satisfies fundamental human need. The chief purpoes of offering public services at no cost is to ensure people going with food, job and basic survivial skills. And with the development of technology, we can not picture the life without internet. That means that the way we have to apply for food, find job oppertunities and learn basic survival skills need to be through internet. Obviously, internet access is necessary for all of citizens, instead of an advanced human need. So providing free internet access is a no doubt decision.



Second reason is that this service enhances the development of society. Offering free internet access reduce the cost people take to obtain acknowledges and to build relationshaip with the others. Thus it is easier for people to acquire better education and to seek commercial partners. That sparks a boor for our society to bring the extra economic and another social benifts. Therefor, although goverments take a given cost to serve people free internet, development of economy and education is the best return.



The implicit rational of disagreement of the statement seems to be that the goverment resources that be used to provid internet access can directly help people to solve the problem of food, clothing and shelter. And the latter needs looks more fundamental. But as we know, teaching a person who is hungry to fish is better than directly giving him fish. Consider Canada's film industry, in which the Canadian goverment invested, which offer a great many jobs for film workers in Canada as a reslut. The same gose for offering free internet access that create the enviroment with good education and economy. Although internet access dose not solve the most basic problem directly, it is helpful to solve the issue that people care about.



In the final analysis,
