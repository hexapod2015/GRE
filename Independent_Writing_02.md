-  agree realistic goals




### Writing

This statement raises a variety of issues about dreams and life goals and the judgement for yousrself. On balance, I agree that we should focus on acheving realistic goals. To the extent, setting a realistic goal is the result of clear judgement for yourself. There are two fundamental arguments imposing on us to prefer to make more efforts to reach realistic  goals.



The first is that the realistic goal is more suitable for you. One of the most crucial abilities for us is judging ourself certainly. This means that you need to clearly know what you are good at and what job do you like. For example,  you dream to be a doctor to save the life of people, that sounds brilliant, but actually you are not good at making decision immediately in the emergency situations that happen usually in the work of doctors.In this enviroment, your choice maybe straightly affect the patients'  life. Not only may people die for your unsuitable decision, but you will fall in the feeling of guilty for this deeply. Are you sure that this great pressure is what you want ? Choosing a job, such as designer or teacher that you have more time to think clear and then make the decision when you face with trade-offs, is better for you. Your dream maybe look wonderful, but the realistic goals is what you really need.

â€‹       

The second reason is that it is more easier for you to come true. Whatever you make efforts for a realistic goal or your ambitious dream, what you really want is success to enjoy the happiness of obtaining. You will often experience failure when you try to come true your dream that is lack of the clear judgement for yourself . Continue failure will break your confident that help you to overcome difficulties. The final result of this is that you may be choose to give up your dream. On the contrary, while you try to reach your realistic goals, you have more confidence that come from your abilities to overcome the difficulties. And then it is easier for you to feel the success.



The implicit rational of disagreement of this statement seems to be that the dream rather corresponds what we desire and the realistic goals is kind of compromise when we are face to issues from the life, though the dream is difficult to reach. Yet the dream may be the result of lack of carefully thinking of what you really want. The ablities we have also should impose on us to adjust our dream. And the ralistic goals also partly base on what you like. 



After the clear judgement of yourself, you set a fitable realistic goal, and you have the ablities and confident to come true it. Why not you need waste time to focus on a ambition dream that is difficult to come true, instead of your realstic goal.
