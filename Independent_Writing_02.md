-  agree realistic goals




### Writing

This statement raises a variety of issues about dreams and life goals and the judgement for yousrself. On balance, I agree that we should focus on acheving realistic goals. To the extent  setting a realistic goal is the result of clear judgement for yourself. There are two fundamental arguments imposing on us to prefer to make more efforts to reach realistic  goals.



The first is that the realistic goal is more suitable for you. One of the most crucial abilities for us is judging yourself certainly. This means that you need to clearly know what you are good at and what job do you like. For example,  you dream to be a doctor to save the life of people, that sounds brilliant, but actually you are not good at making decision immediately in the emergency situations that is usual in the work of doctors.In this enviroment, your choice maybe straightly affect the patients'  life. Not only may people die for your unsuitable decision, but you will fall in the feeling of guilty for this deeply. Are you sure that this great pressure is what you want ? Choosing a job, such as designer or teacher that you have more time to think clear and then make the decision when you face with trade-offs, is better for you. Your dream maybe look wonderful, but the realistic goals is what you really need.

The second reason is that it is more easier for you to come ture. Whatever you make efforts for a realistic goal or your ambitious dream, what you really want is success. Continue failure will break your confident that help you finally
