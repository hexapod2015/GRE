### Writing

This statement raises a variety of issues about dreams and life goals and the judgement for yousrself. On balance, I agree that we should focus on acheving realistic goals. To the extent that we set a realistic goal is the result of clear judgement for yourself. There are two fundamental arguments imposing on us to prefer to make more efforts to reach realistic  goals.



The first is that the realistic goal is more suitable for you.

The second reason is that it is more easier for you to come ture.
